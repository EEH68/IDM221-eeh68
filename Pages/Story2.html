                - The Drexel men's rowing team tied its all-time best finish of 15th overall at the IRA National Championships Sunday morning on Mercer Lake. The Dragons had two boats place in the top-16 nationally, with all boats beating or matching their ranking coming into the races. <br>

                <br>
                The Third Varsity 8+ boat turned in the best performance of the event for the Dragons, tying a best ever finish of 14th.

                <br>
                Drexel got off to a hot start out of the gates, maintaining the second place spot throughout the race. The Dragons pulled away from third place late, beating the nationally ranked teams of Navy, Oregon State, Georgetown, Santa Clara and UC San Diego. <br>
                <br>
