        - James Schmidt, Josh Diggons, Andrew Manns, and head coach Matt Weaver of Drexel men's rowing have been selected to represent the United States at the Under 23 World Championships in St. Catharines, Canada, August 18-25 as announced by USRowing.
        Schmidt will compete in the 2-seat for the men's Quadruple Scull, with Josh Diggons sitting in the stroke seat for the men's Coxed Four. Manns will be a spare for the sculling team. All three Dragons are competing in their first U23 World Championships. Additionally, Weaver will coach for the Senior Men's Lightweight 4x team at the championships.
        The Dragons won their third straight men's title, as well as the overall title at the 85th Jefferson Dad Vail Regatta last season. The Dragons also captured a third consecutive win in the Varsity 8+ race, the first team to do so in 23 years at the Regatta. Drexel finished the season by matching their best ever finish at the IRA National Championships, placing 15th overall.
