                        <!-- - The Drexel men's rowing team tied its all-time best finish of 15th overall at the IRA National Championships Sunday morning on Mercer Lake. The Dragons had two boats place in the top-16 nationally, with all boats beating or matching their ranking coming into the races.
                        The Varsity 8+ team of Chloe Minicucci (Coxswain), Josh Diggons (Stroke), Nikola Loncar, Jack Anderson, Damian Lis, James Schmidt, Andrew Manns, John Little and Andrei Malis (Bow), in Lois Krall III finished in fourth place in the Third Final with a time of 5:49.049.

                        The Third Varsity 8+ boat turned in the best performance of the event for the Dragons, tying a best ever finish of 14th. Rowing in Sandra Lee Sheller II, Matt Sherman (Coxswain), Charlie Fortner (Stroke), Daniel Yurcisin, Matthew Kennedy, Nick Foley, Marawan Mohamed, Jono Andersson, Collin Gross and Dearon Tufankjian finished the Third Final in second place, crossing the line at 5:59.613. 
                        Drexel got off to a hot start out of the gates, maintaining the second place spot throughout the race. The Dragons pulled away from third place late, beating the nationally ranked teams of Navy, Oregon State, Georgetown, Santa Clara and UC San Diego.
                        The 2nd Varsity 8+ team rowing in Lois Krall II also advanced to the Third Final. Alex Dragovits (Coxswain), Nemanja Sajatovic (Stroke), Quinn Cooney, Zoran Bosnic, Michael Pazderski, Roman Smigiel, Richmond Coney, Sam Valigorsky and Zach Key finished 18th overall, coming home with a time of 6:03.693.

                        <!-- - The Drexel men's rowing team took home the men's title for the third consecutive year, as well as the overall points championship at the 85th Jefferson Dad Vail Regatta on Saturday. 
                        The Dragons also captured a third consecutive win in the Varsity 8+ race, the first team to do so in 23 years at the Regatta.
                        The Varsity 8+ team of Chloe Minicucci (Coxswain), Josh Diggons (Stroke), Nikola Loncar, Jack Anderson, Damian Lis, James Schmidt, Andrew Manns, John Little and Andrei Malis (Bow) in Lois Krall III crossed at a time of 5:52.474. The Dragons battled the boat of La Salle throughout the race, as the Explorers led at the 1,000 meter mark by just a seat. With about 500 meters left to go, DU started to pull away from the field, besting La Salle by a boat length at the finish line.
                        The 3rd Varsity 8+ team, in Joseph Griepp, made up of Matt Sherman (Coxswain), Charlie Fortner (Stroke), Daniel Yurcisin, Matthew Kennedy, Nick Foley, Jack Hutchison, Jono Andersson, Collin Gross and Dearon Tufankjian finished atop the podium with a time of 6:10.091. The team dominated the race, winning by over 13 seconds against the second place Temple crew.
                        The Varsity 4+ team won gold in a nailbiter. The team of Charlotte Bentrim (Coxswain), Willem Kirsch (Stroke), Maxwell Frey, Milo Epstein and Samuel Lozek (Bow), in Go Roe, trailed the majority of the race in second place behind Mercyhurst. The Dragons made a late charge, edging the boat of Mercyhurst by just a seat with a time of 6:55.833.
                        Up next for Drexel is  the IRA Nationals, to be held May 31 through June 2 on Lake Mercer in Princeton, N.J. -->
